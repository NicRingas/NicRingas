## Electrical engineer leveraging technologies for a better future. 

- 👋 Hi, I’m @NicRingas
- 👀 I’m interested in Web3 and leveraging technologies to better humanity!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity and how to speak Dutch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source blockchain projects.

## Profile:
I am a self-motivated, detail-oriented electrical engineer that thrives in dynamic environments with diverse teams. I believe my strongest qualities are my approachability and my ability to engage and connect with people from all backgrounds and professions. 

Since 2013 I have been working full-time as an electrical engineer in the pipeline industry. My core roles include performing electromagnetic interference (EMI) studies (and mitigation designs) involving pipelines and overhead power lines and managing all project aspects from inception to completion. 

My roles cover the full project lifecycle and include tender preparation, client engagement, project definition and scoping, managing survey teams, performing designs, preparing technical documentation, managing draftsmen, managing construction teams, and overseeing project hand-over (incl. commissioning activities, hand-over documentation, and client training). I have managed projects in numerous countries for various clients, including Rand Water, Eskom, Transnet Pipelines, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa, Sibanye Gold, Rio Tinto, and Sasol to name a few. 

I have always been fascinated by outer space and its exploration and as such I completed a Masters in Space Sciences part-time. During this time, I published numerous papers and articles, co-authored two books under appointment by the European Space Policy Institute (ESPI) and presented at the 71st International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in 2020. 

I have great written and verbal communication skills and can convey complex ideas in concise and easy to understand methods. I conduct my daily responsibilities with integrity and honesty, and I aim to continually learn and grow. I approach complex engineering tasks with fervor and love finding creative solutions to intricate problems. I am passionate about the Web3 ecosystem and the potential it holds for humanity.
